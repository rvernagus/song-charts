Enhanced Performance Notation (EPN) System

1. Header:
   - Song Title - Artist
   - Key: X | Time Signature | BPM: X | Instrument X

2. Section Headers and Chord Progression:
   - Use ALL CAPS for section names (e.g., INTRO, VERSE, CHORUS)
   - Start chord progression on the same line as the section header
   - Separate section name from chord progression with spaces

3. Chord Notation:
   - Letters represent chords (A, B, C, etc.)
   - Capital letters = Major, lower case = minor
   - Each chord = 4 beats by default
   - A_ = Hold A for 4 beats
   - A|C = A for 2 beats, C for 2 beats
   - G/B = G chord with B in bass

4. Repetition:
   - Use brackets for repeated sections: [A B C D]x2
   - Number after 'x' indicates number of repeats

5. Different Endings within Repeats:
   - Use sub-brackets [ ] within main repeat brackets
   - Precede sub-brackets with applicable repeat numbers
   - Use ',' to combine repeat numbers for the same ending
   - Example: [D D A A G D A [1,2 A] [3 A^]]x3

6. Special Notations:
   - !G = Hit G chord
   - ^ = Stop
   - R = Play riff (defined separately)
   - Ooh = Vocals, right-justified, parens for (background vocals)

7. Chord Qualities:
   - m = minor (Am)
   - 7 = seventh (G7)
   - dim = diminished (Cdim)
   - Add extensions as needed (C9, Fadd9)

8. Presets:
   - {0-5 HDN} = Bank 0, Preset 5, Named "HDN"
   - Place on same line as section name

9. Performance Notes:
   - Use double angle brackets: <<Watch for cue>>

10. Solos:
    - SOLO-8 = 8-bar solo

11. Riff Notation:
    - Use 'R:' followed by simplified tab
    - Example:
      R: 
      |---1-| 
      |-3---|
      |--3--| 
      |-----| 
      |-----| 
      |-3---|

12. (Optional) Key Chords
    - Add chords in the key of the song on the Header lines
    - 1 2 3 4 5 6 7
    - C d e F G a bbm
